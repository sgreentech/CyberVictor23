# Scenario
# Using one of the comparison operators in Python, write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input,
#  which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

n = int(input("Enter a number:"))
m = 100
if n >= m:
    print("True")
else: print ("False")
