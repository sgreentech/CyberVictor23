# Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

# When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

# When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

#   And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

# You will need to use a for loop to write this:


#Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡

for x in range(1, 100):
    if x % 3 == 0 and x % 5 == 0:
        print("FizzBuzz")
    elif x % 3 == 0:
        print("Fizz")
    elif x % 5 == 0:
        print("Buzz")
