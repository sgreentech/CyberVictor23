# Objectives
# Create if statements using these logical conditionals below. Each statement should print information to the screen depending on if the condition is met.

# # Equals: a == b
# a = 5
# b = 5
# if a == b:
#     print("a is equal to b")

# # Not Equals: a != b
# a=6
# b=8
# if a != b:
#     print("a is not b")

# # Less than: a < b
# if a < b:
#     print("a is afraid of b because b is bigger")

# # Less than or equal to: a <= b
# if a <= b:
#     print("a is slightly afraid of b because a could be the same as b")

# # Greater than: a > b
# a=9
# b=8
# if a > b:
#     print("a grew a pair and is now stronger than b")

# # Greater than or equal to: a >= b
# if a>= b:
#     print("a underestimated b, b may be stronger than he looks")

# Create an if statement using a logical conditional of your choice and include elif keyword that executes when other conditions are not met.
# q=8
# z=8
# if q>z:
#     print("q is a superior letter to z")
# elif q:z
# print("they are just letter")

# Create an if statement that includes both elif and else to execute when both if and elif are not met.
q=8
z=8
if q > z:
    print("q is a superior letter to z")
elif q < z:
    print("z is a superior letter to q")
else:
    print("why must we compare letters?")

# Stretch Goals (Optional Objectives)
# Pursue stretch goals if you are a more advanced user or have remaining lab time.

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using and between conditions.
if q > z:
    print("q is a superior letter to z")
elif q < z:
    print("z is a superior letter to q")
   

# Create an if statement with two conditions by using or between conditions.

# Create a nested if statement.

# Create an if statement that includes pass to avoid errors.
